But it's- you're not at the forefront of the business unless you work for a computer company. Then it's completely different. But it's more of a commodity is what I mean.

Bernie was obviously a long shot candidate for sure but there's a reason why he appealed to young audiences so much you know with the erasing of college debt. That was never gonna happen though cuz of the crab in the buck mentality. I mean even my aunt is like I believe 50, 60 thousand dollars in loan debt. So they're like you know I put my hand in the fire you're gonna put your hand in the fire. It's a horrible mindset that we have. But I honestly that's why it is like that."

I think he's gonna step down. I think this is the plan to get Kamala in office because they couldn't get a female in office legitimately. And that's just because you know the way this country is kind of and how it operates you know, they're not gonna have a female president."

Because even if you don't agree with them, they should, there are so many progressives in this country who want change like that, you'd think there'd be some way of getting their opinions closer to the top because I mean Biden, Biden's a democrat but he's not liberal...he's like 2% more socialist than Trump and Trump's 0 you know, it's not-"

One of them's just like the truth and one of them's not  you know like exactly, Trump's policy where it was harming the middle class, and people are like ""no that's Biden""...I'm like, we saw him pass this.

So like ""stand by"" in Oregon. For me, it was kinda funny for 2 reasons: One of like okay, the president of the United States is telling a white nationalist group like ""yeah, stand by me"". The other one which I think a lot of people outside of Oregon don't realize is they're just always here. Like he's trying to word it as like ""oh I'm summoning my groups"" like yeah kind of, but like that's just a part of the Oregon landscape. We have like a crazy number of white nationalists and stuff. So whenever there's national media coverage, I'm like ""oo a group came into Oregon to protest"" I'm like no that's like a problem. This isn't like a new thing.

Like everybody talks about body cams and they're a really great thing for visuals and stuff but the audio aspect of it- if you're trying to transcribe a body cam, you're hearing everybody talking around you and you've got the radio sits right next to the bodycam so you keep hearing the clicking. Not fun...Like I can do multiple people speaking. I can do a few more in certain situations but only life if it it's something scripted and they're going from one person to another.

There was definitely, I think, as you pointed out, like there's not any queer representation in the books.

And my now girlfriend was my best friend, and I talked her into reading the series with me, and it took us 4 months. And we'd be on the phone every single night, 3 or 4 or 5 hours, talking about it and breaking stuff down. We actually just literally- we're regoing through the whole thing right now, waiting for the new book to come out. And we stopped on like the 4th book, and the first 10 chapters took us 3 hours to talk about- because I had read the series the first time, but now she's read it. So she knows the motivations of these characters that we find out down the road. And it's so much fun to get into these conversations and debates. And you learn so much about your partner when that's the thing that you're debating. Like we discuss politics and stuff, but you can only go that far with that before you either confirm you agree on everything or you reach discussions that you can't move on from."

I see how wonderful the thing is. And my partner has seen depression but has never experienced it. So she's just like ""Why do you love this scene so much?"" and I'm like ""let me explain it"". 45 minutes later, she's crying, she's like ""okay now I get it"". But I love being able to figure those things out. I mean that's what you find in a good partner. You're able to keep talking about things no matter what."

My phone has lit up at least twice while we've been talking and probably at least one of them is some disgustingly cute text message that was like ""I'm busy.

So I've never had like an extended break. There's some days where I feel a little guilty and I'm like I want to be more productive. I wanna go back to work. But then I'm like well, I hopefully will never have a time like this again in my life. So, at the same time, it's nice to be able to go and take the dog out for a long walk by the lake at 1 on a Monday afternoon. And you know it's not hurting anybody or anything like that so"

I'm kind of curious myself like the- from the socialist perspective, how this is going to like affect everyone moving forward because for myself, I'm thinking it's gonna be a really hard transition back, but what are gonna be the social aspects of- because I think it's gonan be a really hard transition back for just about everyone.

Like I like econ, you know math. You kind of look at situations and you know analyze them in a more data-oriented way versus an abstract, critical thinking type way...10 classes of philosophy throughout your entire degree, gets you a minor...but they have no prereqs for philosophy in my school so you can just go straight to the 300 level philosophy classes, which are way more fun then like you know introduction to epistemology."

I really liked Comp sci but then- and I had been coding all throughout high school and stuff and it was something I enjoyed. Once I got to college and I thought about like actually doing a career out of it, I was like no. So I was taking a Russian literature course just for fun because I enjoyed it and I then got really close with the department, started taking language courses, started taking linguistics, realized that like along the way, I could do computational linguistics at like the graduate level and kind of went that route.

Yeah he's really awesome...I also have a lot of confidence in Spanish but it's like even though I'm a native speaker, I feel like I read and formally like talk academically or can write better in, I studied Russian and French, so French in high school, and then Russian in college. I feel like I can read and write better in those languages just because in Spanish, it's so informal. And like my mom never finished high school and stuff, so even when she writes to me, it's not in a very advanced way. So I have like a weird confidence not confidence in that language."

But I also have friends that don't go back as often or like you said I mean I grew up here too but they're kids that grew up here and don't speak the language that they their parents speak that well. And that's like you said, it's a tragedy...At least for us I didn't even have to put in any extra work. It just happened by virtue of me being next to my parents. It just happened.

But to be honest, in the community that I come from, I don't think that I've really ever encountered that people want their kids to speak whatever Hindi or Urdu.

At that point in Academic, it was not fun. So I was like I need the biggest break. I need to get out of this school. My russian professor was like hey you're really good at russian. Why don't you go to Russia? and the I think I did all the paperwork and everything within 3, 4 months, and then I went to Russia."
434a157f-6239-4e66-865b-4764e72ed918,right,disclosure,811,1001,190,"Yeah and it was great because my program, we were there for half a semester, so we spent one month in St Petersburg and one month in Moscow. And then every weekend we would do little trips to like villages and rural areas, historic places like that. But then like most of the time we would stay throughout the week in our home, like home city. And I loved it. I thought- there's so many misconceptions about Russian culture and I think it was actually Avaise, me and 2 international students who were from China, Ren and Shi, who got the closest during that trip because we were all very like the rest of the kids were really white and liek very very American. So they had a lot of culture shock from Russia, but all of us came from cultures that were a lot more you know just naturally friendly naturally more intimate than American culture, I would think. Like russians are huge on sharing food together, giving gifts, being really welcoming. Like if you go to someone's house you're expected to bring like flowers every time. If you go to someone's house, they immediately sit you down and offer you food and tea and open their home to you. And it's like a lot of the Americans felt bad they were like ""oh no don't worry about it"" or like ""oh I can't afford this stuff"" like that. Well I think a lot of us who came from more international backgrounds felt more comfortable and you know like being like this is a way to like share and become closer to people without kind of having like a very tit for tat exchange kind of thing. There was a lot of culture shock. There's still a lot of sexism in Russia so I actually went there when I had like super short hair and like looked very alternative. So that was a little bit of a shaky thing where people were like oh but women have long hair what are you doing? you know. But almost everyone we talked to..we could say like really liberal views or really non-traditional views. And they would be like okay interesting. Like that's not how we see it in Russia but maybe that'll change and stuff, which I didn't expect. I expected things to be a lot more closed off....I did my final project on bread...I got to interview a woman who lived through WWII and the siege on Leningrad. So she actually was a little kid when the Nazis surrounded Leningrad and basically starved out the city. And we talked to her about like what it was like going...it was probably one of the most life-changing moments of my life. And it was still really hard because she was an old Russian lady who spoke no English. So we recorded the interview and then had to have the help of my teacher to really get all the details but the experience itself was awesome."

They just have a huge population, without acknowledging the fact that just the amount of lives lost and how they were lost. I never learned about the siege of Leningrad. I never learned about how many kids and women who weren't part of the fighting were lost too. So I hope you learned something. Sorry for ranting."

It was interesting. I didn't expect that. But yeah there's definitely a strong feeling of that. And it's interesting you know being an American and just walking into a room that kind of glorifies like the communist age and like intentionally does so...it's fascinating stuff.

And there's this entire sect of Youtube called the self-bred tube and it's just a bunch of leftist youtubers and they have a lot to say about the USSR and its successes and failures. It's interesting to think in an alternate universe when the USSR didn't have to lose 10s of millions to not only its own civil wars...what the USSR could've looked like and would've looked like.

Like if any other major world power except the US which was founded with so much, the US knows it's a power, I'm gonna get political now, because now that you've said it, I'm also a very big leftist. So the US I think is founded knowing that it needs to have domination in order to continue to exist. Like the US cannot exist in its hyper-consumerism without consuming other countries...I think in a world where any other major power...would have existed, it would have been so different if those were the 2 kind of dipoles of major international affairs where the soviet union and something that wasn't the US.

I'm very left but it's like especially as someone who studies Russia very critically, but also as you can see, like I can't deny that I'm not a russophile considering how much time of my life I dedicate to like understanding Russia and stuff like that, it's hard to find spaces online where you don't get either side of the extreme in any political conversation. But yeah I took a whole class on the 1917 revolution and my professor was so cool because he very much took it as like let's analyze this time period from a bunch of different philosophical viewpoints...And I love that because the revolution when you think about it day by day, is so mindblowing how it happened.
