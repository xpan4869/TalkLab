SPEAKER_00,96.691,181.154,"but the last time i did it that would have been my fourth time and the person didn't show up so so the person showed up the last three times for you i did it twice before i did it twice before and people showed up but one other time i tried and the person didn't show up and that was a little disappointing um and uh Yeah, it was a little disappointing. And this time, I guess the only thing that sucks is that it's nine in the morning. And usually, I don't know what your schedule is like. But for me, I kind of like waking up and having a little bit of like a morning routine. And I'm not used to like waking up and like talking to someone at nine in the morning. But it's like they gave me the schedule and they're like, you know, be up at nine and be ready to talk to someone. So I'm like, okay, I'll do it. No problem. so so this is good um so what do you usually do in the morning uh i'm up at five i usually go for a bike ride around the city uh and then i uh i start working a little bit and then i start working my regular job at 8 30. oh my god you sound like a very impressive person actually you go for a bike ride What city do you live in?",0,

SPEAKER_00,188.101,190.043,And how far do you bike?,0,
SPEAKER_01,192.765,203.176,"Maybe like 5, 10 miles. Not too much. It depends on the day. Like on the weekend, I'll go for like a 40-mile ride. But during the weekday, I just go for a quick ride to clear my head.",1,"SPEAKER_00: [204.66-206.18]: Wow, that's really..."
SPEAKER_00,206.733,245.755,"very enviable i kind of i kind of envy that because i'm i think i'm a pretty i think i'm a pretty sedentary person and i think that i need to get a little bit more physically active and you're gonna laugh but for me i feel like listen if i can do a 15 to 20 minute walk a day that would be something And you doing 5 to 10 miles and then doing 40, really, really impressive, Jack. Like, that's really impressive. That's, like, really great.",0,
SPEAKER_01,246.175,254.627,I kind of have to. It's not because I want to. It's because otherwise I'll have back pain. So I need to stay busy or my back will hurt.,1,SPEAKER_00: [255.81-256.19]: Really?
SPEAKER_01,256.269,258.512,"So it's kind of forced me into this, yeah.",0,
SPEAKER_00,258.532,315.616,"Have you – I had back surgery – probably it's you know it's weird i don't know what it is about me but i have a very bad memory when it comes to things that happened in my life i know i had back surgery but if you were to ask me like what year did you have it i couldn't tell you i want to say like in the early 2000s i um i blew a disc i blew a disc and it's like a majority of the disc like stayed in place. But I think the contents of the disc went out into the column and started pressing, started pressing against a nerve. And I had like numbness in my leg and I had to go and get surgery to remove that. And did you ever have back surgery or you just had back pain?",0,
SPEAKER_01,315.677,454.9,"No, just back pain. uh it started with uh maybe two years ago i started a new like desk job and uh you know doing turking and things like doing work like this uh i sit way too much oh wait you were doing you when you said you said you were doing like mturk yep yep okay go on i'm sorry i didn't need to interrupt no no i just i you know in this modern world in order to make money i find myself sitting in front of a computer for way too long every day right so i gotta you know the only thing that seems to alleviate that is exercising and uh doing yoga i do yoga as much as i can uh i just i gotta move around if i don't move around by the end of the day i'm like in agony working in agony like like i'm ready to not do this anymore that bad so i just stay active right so now you said your first your first job is at 5 30 and then your second job is at 8 30 or no i just have a day job from 8 30 to 4. um but i like to make more money so i'm always hustling so i'll do anything i'll sell stuff on craigslist i'll do work on amazon mturk i'll work on prolific there's a few other websites things like that anything to make a few extra bucks so let me can you explain to me how mturk work how does mturk pay way worse than prolific um really yeah i mean it's pretty hard i think to even get get on now they reject a lot of people when you apply um you kind of gotta get better with like coding it's not not coding but you have to like install web uh extensions on your browser to kind of help enhance it because if you just work on the website straight face value you're not going to make a lot of money you're going to work really hard but once you have the technology and the stuff in the browser it kind of searches through the tasks and picks the better paying tasks so you can kind of you can roll through the requesters and see who makes shitty surveys and who makes well-paying ones and you just focus on the well-paying ones and it makes i don't know five to ten a day on a good day maybe 10 20 uh you know maybe more than 20.",0,
SPEAKER_00,456.162,483.295,"So in other words, for a person like me who does, I don't really understand a lot, even about what you said. I just have a computer. I just have like a computer and I know, I know how to fill out a survey, but that's about it. The other stuff you were talking about, like, whoa, right over my head. So maybe MTurk isn't for me?",0,
SPEAKER_01,483.315,502.492,"No, I think, I mean, if you're doing stuff like this, I think you should definitely be doing MTurk. You should look up, like, Reddit is a good website, Reddit, and it'll, like, you can look, you know, like Google MTurk, how to make money more efficiently, stuff like that. And it'll explain everything I said probably a lot better than I just did.",0,
SPEAKER_00,503.453,509.105,"No, wait, Reddit, isn't Reddit... sort of an information website?",0,
SPEAKER_01,510.186,525.867,"Yeah, I mean, it's kind of morphing into like, you can do like instant message now on it too. I think it's going to be like an up and coming website. I mean, at least as far as good information, that's the best website out there. I think, I mean, in terms of a lot of different things.",0,
SPEAKER_00,527.369,531.394,But you're saying you can't make money on Reddit. You go to Reddit to find out information.,0,
SPEAKER_01,531.56,565.241,yes you know like anything you want to like if you want to do something better you just google it and then by tomorrow you'll probably be a little bit more efficient yeah so i mean i guess the thing is is that i really prefer to be paid via paypal and i heard mturk pays differently and uh it's a i set up an automatic oh are you still there okay uh yep everything's good all right go on I set up automatic payments. It goes right to my bank account every three days.,0,
SPEAKER_01,567.283,570.847,"Right. So it's a constant, steady stream of income.",0,
SPEAKER_00,570.907,581.678,"No, no, no. I'm totally okay with you going to my bank account. I just heard that MTurk pays via Amazon or something, and I don't want to...",0,
SPEAKER_01,582.199,611.483,"It's just Amazon owns everything, right? So Amazon now has a banking... branch so it like for a minute it goes to like amazon's intermediate and then i mean it's the transfers within a day so i mean i don't really care where it goes in that day before it hits my bank account all right so so as long as you can so you can route it you can route it to go to your bank it's automatic yeah you can you can you can request like amazon gift cards and things like that or you can request cash",0,
SPEAKER_00,611.682,671.476,it's just an option yeah all right i would definitely i would definitely want to route it i would definitely want to route it to my bank account yeah and then every three days because you never know when a site might close down with your money in it i mean it just happens right so you're saying prolific for you prolific has been better than mturk less work but the work's easier and quicker and more suited towards me right okay all right um i've been trying to do um these um what are they called they're like uh public no these like research things where you you have to drive to like a facility but they'll make you drink seltzer and then like comment on whether you like the seltzer or they want you to smell cat litter and tell you how the cat litter smells But then they give you cash or they give you like a Visa gets card.,0,
SPEAKER_00,673.059,715.146,"Unfortunately, unfortunately, it's not it's not that often. Yeah. You know what I mean? So you have to like call and check in and see. And where I live in New Jersey, there's not. there's not that many of them where my sister lives my sister lives in like north jersey like near new york city yeah yeah so there's a lot there's a lot more of them and i live like in central jersey like uh near the ocean yeah there's not there's not as much going on same here and uh you know what i mean so um what is your what is your regular job what do you do from eight to four",0,
SPEAKER_01,715.396,742.078,uh i work at the department of human services i get people food stamps health insurance things like that oh that sounds really nice yeah it's been a long journey um been in that kind of field for about 10 years and this is a good relaxing desk job so i like it well i um i recently became disabled sorry to hear that i um i have bipolar disorder,0,
SPEAKER_00,742.463,832.962,"And to be honest, I would say like since I was 14, every time I started a job, every time I started a job, I would have these racing thoughts, overwhelming feelings of panic and dread and doom, anxiety, nightmares, feelings like I want to vomit. um but obviously you need to make money you need to pay your bills right so i would like put up with it and i would like handle it and um i guess i got to the point where like dude i wasn't able like i i would basically hold down a job for like maybe like two years and then i would like get i would get in a car accident because the anxiety was like so terrible that I wouldn't be able that like I wouldn't in other words like I wouldn't be able to like keep it together and like I would get in a car accident and then I'd end up going on like temporary disability yeah and I'd get better and like I'd get another job and then I threw my back out Yeah. So in other words, it wasn't just like up here. It would end up manifesting. It would end up manifesting itself in my body.",0,
SPEAKER_01,832.982,838.07,"So let's say maybe if you could work from home, would that have maybe been a little easier?",0,
SPEAKER_00,840.454,847.986,"Well, wait a minute. Hello, Ada? Did you get your keys?",0,
SPEAKER_00,853.889,855.271,"All right, well, what happened?",0,
SPEAKER_00,858.055,908.348,"All right, can I call you back in like 10 minutes? Let me call you right back. All right, bye. All right, so you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking now if I, this is like my life goal. My life goal is if I can maybe work 10 to 15 hours a week under the table and get paid via paypal or and the idea is like not be anxious at work and not be anxious when i'm home that would be like a major victory for me are you gonna collect social security at the same time yeah",0,
SPEAKER_01,908.8,935.331,be careful about under the under uh yeah be careful about that if you're getting under you know unreported income they'll they'll screw you over bad they will take money yeah you can make up to a thousand dollars i believe and it shouldn't affect your you want to know what happened i found a gig,0,
SPEAKER_00,935.902,956.104,"And the gig was, you froze. No, you're okay now. I did this thing where it was this thing where you would basically chat on a website with other people about anything, gardening, how your day was. And they would pay you $50 a week.",0,
SPEAKER_00,958.086,1044.445,"So that's nothing. That's $200 a month. And I contacted Disability. And I said, listen, I'm doing, so I'm trying to do on the up and up and I'm trying to be honest and do the right thing. And immediately, immediately they sent me a letter saying, we're going to review your file to see if you're still eligible. I mean, think about the anxiety and the dread. Like immediately they're like, well, maybe, maybe you don't qualify for disability anymore because you're earning $50 a month or $50 a week. So, I mean, it filled me with absolute terror. yeah do you have is there someone like a social worker that could kind of help you with them because i mean that agency is just terrible to deal with for anybody um but i mean but you can imagine like you can get what i'm saying why like that would be absolutely terrifying like i'm trying to do the right thing i'm trying to follow the rules and the way you you thank me is by sending me a letter saying now you're going to review my file yeah i mean i know every state's different but i know in rhode island there's an exception where you can make up to a thousand you know there is in new jersey no dude in new jersey there's the same exact rule and i i was just thinking like okay so i'm doing the right thing i'm telling you i'm earning 200 a month which is nothing it's something like and you want to talk about the bare minimum",0,
SPEAKER_01,1044.948,1086.379,they are going to review it so basically what happens i mean i mean i don't think 200 a month would offset it but the worst case that i'm not a social security guy i don't want to say the wrong thing but i imagine the worst that would happen is they're going to take out a little bit of your check but you know to make the amount that you know you make should be higher than the check but the worst that they would happen is maybe one month reduce a little bit of the benefit because you made more right i think i just got scared i think i just got really really scared i would be that's a scary thing we're going to review you i felt very i felt very triggered and i felt very threatened yeah yeah so i met this i met this woman i met this woman,0,
SPEAKER_00,1086.781,1200.031,"And she runs this Ethiopian Dominican restaurant. And I was I was in the Peace Corps like 20 years ago in Ethiopia. So I'm very like attracted. I'm very attracted to like Ethiopian people and Ethiopian restaurants. And I want to like practice the language, even though like I barely remember the language anymore. Yeah. And we became friendly. And I said, listen, what if like once a week or twice a week I came by and I just helped you in the back and I just like cut the carrots, cut the onions, like I measured out the French fries. And she's like, well, I would give you some money. And I said, well, you give me what you think is fair. So I've been sort of going there and I give her a hug and I'm like, oh, do you need help today? And so I've been sort of doing that and it just makes me feel like I'm not useless and I'm not helpless. And honestly, Jack, I don't want to feel like my life is over. I don't want to feel like I'm doing nothing. You know what I mean? But still, I've been feeling a lot of anxiety. Even with that, even doing that, like just helping somebody, I feel a lot of anxiety. And I called disability and they told me, even if you're going to do something where you're working and doing like that $50 a week, every month you have to send us a sheet of paper telling us how much you earned. Yeah. And like every month I've got to like report to them. So it's like a part-time job. So it's just, it's very stressful.",1,SPEAKER_01: [1201.53-1201.75]: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01,1201.792,1249.105,"I mean, it's kind of, it becomes self-employment, right? I mean, at some point you just have to keep a record of all that's coming in. I mean, with food stamps, if you tell me you're making a little bit more money, I'm going to come, I'm going to find out. You need to tell me how much, like, especially the self-employed people. You can tell me it's only $25. That's on you. right i mean the records but you need to keep a record because whether it's the department of human services or whether it's the tax man we want to know how much you made a month i mean it's just how it goes so i would just write a written record but i can imagine how that's very stressful right that's got to be tough so that's me so basically you have like seven jobs and i have like i have half a job i've got one job i've worked since i was about 10.",0,
SPEAKER_00,1249.658,1277.472,uh i shouldn't have enough money to stop working so say this again you wait you i said this is the last thing i heard was i have half a job and you have seven jobs and then you started talking but you froze i got you i've got one job one day job which is the human services yeah yep and uh i've been working since i was about 10.,0,

SPEAKER_00,1437.678,1462.829,"I feel like there's a finite amount of money. You need a set amount of money to be able to live month to month. And then as time goes by, things get more expensive. And you don't know when you're going to die, right? Now, obviously, what if you live to 90? You need to have a certain amount of money set aside. So I mean, have you considered that?",0,
SPEAKER_01,1466.654,1490.743,"I've got a good deal of money. Once I pay off my mortgage, it's just a matter of keeping my day job. My day job comes with health insurance, pension.
